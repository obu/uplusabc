The state of AI presentation 2017:  https://www.infoq.com/presentations/state-ai-2017   <-- Keynotes by Jim McHugh
There will be "Global Big Data Conference" and "Gloable AI Conference" Jan 19,20,21, 2018 in Santa Clara Convention Center.
It is called "Global Big Data Conference's vendor agnostic Global Artifical Intelligence Conference"

The most impressive takeaway for me is that people trained the program to read the lips and get 90% accuracy, 
and the best human can only get 50-60% accuracy.

Another takeaway is that robotics are no being programmed to do things; rather they learn to do things.

From the theory point of view:  AI has 3 stages:  ANI,  AGI,  ASI.   Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI.  We are now
at the narrow AI stage.  AI can be applied to a narrow scope, or a specific task.  Once AI reaches general level, it 
can reach super level very quickly.  The super level is the level that people worry that machine can take over the world.

There are people or organizations doing the AI impact to business.  For example, www.sas.com has an aritcle talking about
how to integrate AI into the business strategy. Will upload this document.

Tried googled "AI + Building" and found -- A.I. Architecture Intelligence -- An European effort to come up something AI
in architectural fields.  futurearchitectureplatform.org <--reads future architecture platform dot org.
